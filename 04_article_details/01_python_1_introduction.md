In this chapter you'll be creating the articles details page which is the page that basically has all the information that we didn't show in the list. In this page we can show the content of the article, the author, who contributed, and just any information we want to show about this specific article. All articles will have the same details page, the only difference is the information shown on the page.


Take a look at the [live demo](http://thereadingpotato.codeunicorn.io/) and click on any article to see its details page. Notice that the page looks exactly the same for all articles and notice the url and how it's changing with each article. So, this is only one page but with different information displayed. Since it's only one page, then we need one `view`, one `url`, and one `template`.


Note: In the live demo, you're getting the article title in the url. However, in this chapter you'll be doing things a bit differently.

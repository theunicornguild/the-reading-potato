Let's go through everything we've done in this chapter.

 * We've created a view that receives an article id from the url and gets that specific article from the databse.
 * The retrieved article is sent to the `template` through the context dictionary for the information to be displayed.
 * Finally, we've connected the articles list page to the details page.


Make sure your code is working and that when you click on an article it takes you to the details page. If it's not working debug your code. If you get an error, try to read it to find out what the problem is and if you still can't find out what that problem is try and google. This will help improve your debugging skills so always try to find the solution on your own before asking for help.


If you go it to work, move your trello card and push your code.

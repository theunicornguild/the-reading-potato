To help you continue to build your skills, I have a few suggestions to help you build on what you've already learned.

If you want to improve this website, you can add more features to it. For example:

 * A user gets points for each accepted contribution
 * A scoreboard that has the top 10 contributers with their scores.
 * If a user's contribution was rejected more than 5 times on the same article, he's blacklisted and can't contribute to this article anymore.

These are just ideas on how you can build on this project. You can start doing those ideas or you can come up with ideas of your own and actually make something out of the reading potato.


On the other hand, If you'd like to work on something else to improve your skills in django, I have two suggestions:
 
 * [My Rent](https://codeunicorn.io/p/my-rent): This project will build on the skills that you've gained here and go one step further into integrating payment and sms services.
 * [Crumble Mumble](https://codeunicorn.io/p/crumble-mumble): This project digs deeper into forms and the use of javascript to make the website more dynamic.

As the name suggests, I just wanted to congratulate you on the great effort you've put into finishing this project. You've learned alot in this one project. 


Take the time to let it all sink in. Go through your code again and try to experiment with new things or new pages that you can add to this website just to you can apply what you've learned but on your own.


In this project you've learned all of this:

 * How to create a django project.
 * what models are and how to use them.
 * How to create a webpage (`view`, `template`, `url`).
 * How to query and access the database.
 * How to create `forms` and use them.
 * Authentication(`login`, `register`, `logout`).
 * last but not least, you learned a bit of design.


With these skills you have the base to build any website you want. The more you practice the better you'll be at this.

The idea of the reading potato is to raise awareness and increase potato literacy. With the reading potato, the world will get better one potato at a time and this is how we do it...

The reading potato allows people to share their thoughts and ideas by writing articles for people to read. The cool thing though is that people can collaborate and contribute to these articles. You as a writer can see the made contributions to your articles and review them and then either accept or decline them. At the same time, you can see the status of the contributions you made to other peoples articles and see if they accepted or declines your contribution.


Take a look at the demo website to get a better idea of what your going to build throughout this project.

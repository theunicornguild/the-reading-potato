In this project you'll be using both `trello` and `git`.


#### Trello

`Trello` is a tool used to help you keep track of your work. What you need to do...what you've already finished and so on.

Open the projects `Trello` board which you'll find in the `Resources` section. In the board you'll find 4 lists:
* `IceBox`: this list has all the cards/functionalities that are nice to have but not necessary (iceboxed).
* `Backlog`: this list has all the cards/functionalities that we need to do.
* `Doing`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that you are currently working on.
* `Review`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that you finished but need to be reviewed by someone.
* `Done`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that are done.


Right now all the cards are in the `backlog` list because we haven't started working on the project. So, as we start working in this project, we'll be moving the cards to different lists. 


Before you can move the cards, you need to copy the board into your account. This'll help you figure out how to do that [copying boards](https://help.trello.com/article/802-copying-cards-lists-or-boards).

#### Git

We'll be using git throughout the project to keep track of the changes we're making to the code and create checkpoints everytime we finish a functionality.

Since this project will be made from scratch, you will need to create a new git repo in [github](https://github.com/) and you'll push your project there.

In this project you'll be using both `trello` and `git`.


#### Trello

`Trello` is a tool used to help you keep track of your work. What you need to do...what you've already finished and so on.

Open the projects `Trello` board which you'll find in the `Resources` section. In the board you'll find 4 lists:
	* `IceBox`: this list has all the cards/functionalities that are nice to have but not necessary (iceboxed).
	* `Backlog`: this list has all the cards/functionalities that we need to do.
	* `Doing`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that you are currently working on.
	* `Review`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that you finished but need to be reviewed by someone.
	* `Done`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that are done.


Right now all the cards are in the `backlog` list because we haven't started working on the project. So, as we start working in this project, we'll be moving the cards to different lists.

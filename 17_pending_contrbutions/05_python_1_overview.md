So far, you should be able to contribute to articles. See who contributed to you articles and see contributions that you made to other people's articles. Go through this whole cycle, make sure everything is working as expected. If all is well, move the card and push the code so we can move the interesting part.


## Trello

> Move card `As a logged in user, I can see a list of my articles that people contributed in and need my review` to the `Review` list if someone will needs to review it, otherwise move it to `Done`.

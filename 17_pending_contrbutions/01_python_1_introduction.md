In this chapter you'll be creating the page where you'll be able to see all the contributions made to your articles that are awaiting your approval. 

If you take a look at this page of the live demo `http://thereadingpotato.codeunicorn.io/contributions/`, it'll give you a better idea of what we're trying to build here.

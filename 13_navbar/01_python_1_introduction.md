Now that our website is expanding, we need a better way to navigate through the pages rather than having to write the url for each page. So, we need to create a `navbar` which will have a link for all the pages that our website provides. If you go to the live demo, you'll see for example that the login and registration links are there. If these weren't there there would be no way for the user to go to these page other than manually typing the url for that.

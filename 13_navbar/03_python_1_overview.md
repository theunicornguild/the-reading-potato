The navbar should now be shown on all you pages. So, go through all the pages to make sure it's there. At the same time, don't forget to add links to whatever pages you want on the navbar then test those liks and that they're actually taking you to the correct page. If all is well, push the code.


### Git

Create a new checkpoint

```shell
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "added navabr to base.html"
$ git push
```

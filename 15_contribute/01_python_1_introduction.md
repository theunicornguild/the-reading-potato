We're finally in the interesting part. This is where we'll start with allowing other users to contribute to the articles. The author will see those contributions and what changes were made to the article and then decide whether they want to accept or decline these changes.

In this chapter, we'll do the actual action of contributing. Where a user can see the whole article and change things in it to contribute. Open the live demo and ry to contribute to an article to get an idea of what we're trying to build here.

## Trello
> Move card `As a logged in user, I can contribute to any article's content and wait for approval` from the `Backlog` to the `Doing` list.

All we did in this chapter is create a base template and make all the others templates inherit from it. Make sure all the pages(list and detail) are inheriting from the `base.html`. Once you made sure everything is okay push your code.

### Git

Create a new checkpoint

```shell
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "added a base file for all pages"
$ git push
```

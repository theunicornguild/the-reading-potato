This is what we've done so far to create this page.
 
 * We created a view that receives the article id from the url to retrieve the `Article` and then fill the `ArticleForm` with it.
 * We created a template to display the form.
 * We created a path/url connected to the `edit_article` view.

Make sure your server is running and try out the edit page that you created and make sure it's working. I'd recommend that you take the time now and add your own touches...add links that you connect the different pages you created...add a bit of styling...just do anything that you think may enhance the user experience.

This chapter only includes a bit of tweaking here and there. So we'll just be improving the website making it more user friendly and just enhancing the user experience. To do that, I thought we can do the following:

 * Add a search bar so users can search for any article they want.
 * Next we can paginate the list of articles.
 * We'll add something called a `slug` which you'll know more about in that section.


 These section should be light and fun. Enjoy

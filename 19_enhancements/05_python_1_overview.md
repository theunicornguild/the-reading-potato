After this chapter, you should have a fully functional searchbar. I'd recommend that you experiment more with the searchbar. Why stop at only searching for an article by title...why not search by author too for example or any other field that you want. There is something called `Q` in django to create more complex queries. I'll just leave this [reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/queries/#complex-lookups-with-q-objects) here in case you want to dig deeper in this.


Also, you were introduced to pagination and how to apply it. You can now try and apply it to any page that has lists in it to just get more exposed to it.


Finally, you now know what slugs are. These really do give a facelift to a project.

Now your project is done and tweaked.

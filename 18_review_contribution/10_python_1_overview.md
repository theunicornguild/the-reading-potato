First of all congratulations on finishing the contributions part of this project.

Now, let's go over what we've done in this chapter. First, to create the review page, we used the `difflib` library to compare the old and new/modified article and showed the difference to the user for his review.


Then, we did the accept and reject actions where the user can either accept the proposed changes and apply them to the article or just decline them and each of these actions had its own view.


Last but not least, We had to modify the `article_details` view so that it retrieves all the accepted to contributions so we can show the names of the contributors in the details page.


Before moving on to the last chapter, Go through everything you've done in terms of trying out your website and make sure everything is working as expected. If anything isn't, debug it and test it again until it works properly. After you're done, move on to the next chapter.

This chapter has everything contribution related. Everything that's still left from the contributions is happening here. We'll moving lots of cards throughout this chapter. Here is what we're going to do:

 * Create the page where the user can see changes/contribution made to his article.
   * If you go to this page in the live demo `http://thereadingpotato.codeunicorn.io/contributions/` and press on the review button, you should see the page that we're trying to build. (if there aren't any contributions, create another account and contribute to your article).

 * We'll do both the accept and decline actions for the contribution. These are just buttons that you should be able to see in the contribution review page in the live demo.

 * Finally, we'll be adding the list of contributors in the article details page.


Once you finish this chapter all of these should be done. Since alot is happening in this chapter, do not forget to test each functionality out before moving on to the next one.


Since we'll be starting with the review page, you can start by moving that cart to doing.

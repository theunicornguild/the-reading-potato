Users won't be registering through the `createsuperuser` command, nor will they login through the admin page. So, we need to start providing them with pages where they can register and login. So, in this chapter we'll be working on the registration page. 


Go to the live demo and take a look at the registration page. If you want a challenge, I'd recommend that you try and do this part on your own without reading the sections. It's not hard. It's actually almost identical to creating an `Article`. The difference is the model, we were creating `Article` objects, but here registration is creating `User` objects. Give it a go. Try to do this on your own and the sections are always here to help you.

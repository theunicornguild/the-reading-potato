Now that users are able to create their own articles, it would make sense to provide them with a page where they can view only the articles that they created. So this is what we'll be doing in this chapter. It's very similar to the articles list page but with a bit of tweaking.


You'll find the page in `http://thereadingpotato.codeunicorn.io/my-articles/` in the live demo. This will give you an idea of what we're trying to build.


## Trello
> Move card `As a logged in user, I can see a list of my articles` from the `Backlog` to the `Doing` list.

If you've done everything right, you should be able to see only articles that were created by the user you're logged in as when you access this page `127.0.0.1:8000/my-articles/`.

I know I've been saying this in every overview but I can't emphasize on this enough. Do not continue to the next chapter until you make sure this functionality is working properly. After you test and debug it, move the card and push the code.

## Trello
> Move card `As a logged in user, I can see a list of my articles` from the `Doing` to the `Review` list if someone will needs to review it, otherwise move it to `Done`.

### Git

Create a new checkpoint

At this point permissions should be added. Things that a non logged in user shouldn't see are not shown in the template and vice versa. Go through your pages and try to access pages that you shouldn't access to make sure your permissions are working and the redirections are correct. 


Check your navbar and make sure only appropriate links are shown when a user is either loggen in or not. If all is good, commit and push.


### Git

Create a new checkpoint

```shell
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "added permissions"
$ git push
```

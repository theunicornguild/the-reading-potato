This is what we've done so far to create this page.
 
 * We created a form for the `Article` model.
 * We created a view that uses that form.
 * We created a template to display the form.
 * We created a path/url to the `create_article` view.

Make sure your server is running and go to this url `127.0.0.1/create/`. Try out the page that you made and check that when you submit a the form or press the create button, an article is being created and saved to the database. If the page is working move the card and push the code. Otherwise, try and debug the code, find out what's wrong. I don't recommend that you move to the next chapter with things still not working, it'll only make things harder to debug. Make sure this is working then move forward.

In this chapter we'll be creating the page where the users can create and add a new article. Just like the previous pages, you'll need a `view`, `template`, and a `url`. However, the new part here is something called `forms` which will be explained in the next section.

Go to this page in the live demo http://thereadingpotato.codeunicorn.io/create/ (you need to be logged in). This is the page that you'll be creating next.

## Trello
> Move card `As a logged in user, I can add a new article` from the `Backlog` to the `Doing` list.
